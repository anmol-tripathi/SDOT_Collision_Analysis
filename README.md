According to the annual United States road crash statistics by ASIRT, more than
38,000 people die every year in crashes on U.S. roadways. The U.S. traffic fatality
rate is 12.4 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. It is evident that with the increasing
number of vehicles on urban and suburban roads, the cases of vehicle accidents
are also increasing. <br><br>
This project aims to analyse vehicle collision data available in
public domain provided by Seattle Geo Data (SDOT) and derive some useful
insights.
